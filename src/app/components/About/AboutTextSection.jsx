            Clients should be able to trust the integrity and expertise of the
            builder. They ought to be treated as real people to be diligently
            served by a trusted advisor rather than vending machines to be
            manipulated and coerced into the fastest possible fee. Clients have
            the right to never have to worry about a builder taking quality
            shortcuts, engaging in financial dishonesty, or not standing behind
            their work.

            clients that appreciate their expertise and trust them as
            professionals. They should make a fair profit and invest in taking
            care of their employees, providing career paths and futures for
            those that dedicate their skills to the cause.

            efficient for everyone, giving these partners the best opportunity
            to also make a fair profit and have the satisfaction of having their
            work and expertise be appreciated.
